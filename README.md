Led-control
===========

PT-LED-Control is a program to set up behavioural experiments that implies LED's with different colours and brightness.
This software is formed by two programs, one being the arduino software which drives the LED's and the other one

Although, this program is working, is still a work in progress. 
Any collaboration is wellcome.
