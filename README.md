Led-control
===========

PT-LED-Control is a program to set up behavioural experiments that implies LED's with different colours and brightness.
This software is formed by two programs, one being the arduino software which drives the LED's and the other one 
a program to set up the experiment in which you can select the duration, periods of light and dark, and intenisity.

Although, this program is working, is still a work in progress. 
Any collaboration is wellcome.

##Installation:

The LED control is a python package with PySide 1.2.4 as dependency. Due to this dependency it is compatible with python version until 3.4. It is possible to use it with python 3.6 but some tinkering is neccesary.(or the use of a linux distro).
It can be installed following this steps.
1. Install PySide. Follow the instructions for your specific operating system: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PySide/1.2.4
1. Download the Led-control zip file from Github.
2. In a terminal or console, navigate to the folder where the zip file is.
3. use pip install led-control-master.zip
